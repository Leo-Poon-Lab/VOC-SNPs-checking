## VOC-SNPs-checking

*Haogao Gu, Leo Poon*

---

The repository hosts the R scripts for checking the number of lineage defining SNPs appeared in the input genomes.

Use `./scripts/generate_nt_pos.r` to parse AA positions of lineage defining SNPs into NT positions.

Base on the constellations of mutations for the SARS-CoV-2 virus shared by [
CoV-lineages](https://github.com/cov-lineages/constellations).
